Next, an eyelet screw will be screwed into the center of the dowel such that there is an equal length of dowel on both sides of the eyelet. The top of a quick release handle will be  locked into the eye of the eyelet screw. The dowel will be placed in the center of the top of two Group A planks on the upper rectangle. The dowel will be positioned such that there is 5.08 centimeters of the dowel hanging off each side of the apparatus. In addition, the dowel will be rotated such that the eyelet screw will be facing down. Finally, a screw will be fastened into each of the two junctions of the Group A planks and the dowel, such that each screw passes through the top of each end of the dowel and into the center of the top long side of each Group A plank in the upper rectangle.

The mean of the Fmax forces for each testing group was recorded, and the percent of impact attenuation relative to the baseline was calculated by subtracting the mean Fmax of a flooring material from the mean Fmax of the baseline group and then dividing the difference by the mean Fmax of the baseline group.</td>

One pound of modelling clay will be added to the inside of each of the 3D printed parts, and an indent in the clay will be left for the tri-axial accelerometer. The tri-axial accelerometer will be placed in the center of the front part of the head, and both parts of the dummy head will be fastened together using wood glue.</td>
